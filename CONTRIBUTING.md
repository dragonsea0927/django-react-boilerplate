## Testing your changes

### Testing `django-admin startproject`

If you made changes to this boilerplate and want to test them, do as following:

- [Make sure you have pre-commit installed](https://github.com/vintasoftware/django-react-boilerplate#pre-commit-hooks)
- Commit your changes
- Run `git archive -o boilerplate.zip HEAD` to create the template zip file
- Run the following:
  ```bash
  cd .. && django-admin startproject theprojectname --extension py,yml,json --name Procfile,README.md,.env.example,Dockerfile --template=django-react-boilerplate/boilerplate.zip
  ```
- A new folder called `theprojectname` will be created and now you can test your changes
- Make sure that the project is still running fine with and without docker
